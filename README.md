# Inverter Network Smart Contracts
*Inverter is the pioneering web3 protocol for token economies, enabling conditional token issuance, dynamic utility management, and token distribution. Build, customize, and innovate with Inverter's modular logic and extensive web3 interoperability.*

## Installation

The Inverter Network smart contracts are developed using the [foundry toolchain](https://getfoundry.sh)

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into the repository
3. Run `make install` to install contract dependencies
4. (_Optional_) Run `source dev.env` to set up environment variables

## Usage

Common tasks are executed through a `Makefile`. The most common commands are:
* `make build` to compile the project.
* `make test` to run the test suite.
  * Note: _Some of our tests  require a working Sepolia RPC URL, as we test certain contracts via fork testing. We implemented fallbacks in these cases in the code directly, so they should work even without any RPC set in the environment. If that does not work, please set a working one via `export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://rpc-url-here`._
* `make pre-commit` to ensure all of the development requirements are met, such as
  * the Foundry Formatter has been run.
  * the scripts are all working.
  * the tests all run without any issues.

Additionally, the `Makefile` supports a help command, i.e. `make help`.

```
$ make help
> build                    Build project
> clean                    Remove build artifacts
> test                     Run whole testsuite
> update                   Update dependencies
> [...]
```
