## Security Reviews and Audits

At Inverter Network, we prioritize the security of our smart contracts and follow a rigorous process of security reviews and audits:

* Per our development and security guidelines, we require an external review for each pull request (PR) that goes from the `dev` branch to the `main` branch in our repository. We have partnered with [Team Omega](https://teamomega.eth.limo) to conduct these security reviews directly in the PRs.

* Additionally, prior to major releases, we perform a full audit of any changed contracts via an external auditing company before the deployment. This ensures that our contracts undergo thorough scrutiny by professional auditors.

* Our version 1 has been audited by [0xMacro](https://0xmacro.com/) and underwent a public audit competition on [Hats Finance](https://hats.finance/), leveraging the expertise of the broader security community.

We are committed to transparency and will make the results of our security reviews and audits available to the public, fostering trust and confidence in the security of our platform.
